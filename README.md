## TNoodle-Lib-Native

- this is a fork of the current [tnoodle-lib](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle-lib)
- we provide a prebuilt `xcframework` for ios_arm64 and ios_x86_64 for simulator support
  - the binaries are natively compiled using [graavlm](https://www.graalvm.org/), [their github](https://github.com/oracle/graal)
  - you can find the xcframework under [our Releases](https://github.com/CubeStuffs/tnoodle-lib-native/releases/tag/v1.0)
