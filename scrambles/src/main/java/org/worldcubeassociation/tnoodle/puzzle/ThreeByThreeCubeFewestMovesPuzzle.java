        // orientation step, which competitors might intentionally (or even
        // accidentally!) use in their solution. To lower the probability of this happening,
        // we intentionally generate dumbed down solutions.

        // We eventually decided to go with "Tom2", which is described by Tom

        // If we're going this direction, and the exact length isn't critical, why not combine a bunch of the
        // ideas we've seen so far into something this simple:
        //
        // 1. Fix a set of prefix/suffix moves, say, U F R / U F R.
        // 2. For a given position p, find *any* solution where that solution prefixed and suffixed with
        //    the appropriate moves is canonical.
        //
        // That's it.  So we generate a random position, then find any two-phase solution g such
        // that U F R g U F R is a canonical sequence, and that's our FMC scramble.
        //
        // The prefix/suffix will be easily recognizable and memorable and ideally finger-trick
        // friendly (if it matters).
        //
        // Someone wanting to practice speed FMC (hehe) can make up their own scrambles just
        // by manually doing the prefix/suffix thing on any existing scrambler.
        //
        // It does not perturb the uniformity of the random position selection.
        //
        // It's simple enough that it is less likely to suffer from subtle defects due to the
        // perturbation of the two-phase search (unlikely those these may be).
        //
        // And even if the two-phase solution is short, adding U F R to the front and back makes it
        // no longer be unusually short (with high probability).

        // I think that something more like R' U' F (some sequence that
        // involves a quarter-turn on all three "axes") is better because it
        // guarantees at least one bad edge in every orientation; with EO-first
        // options becoming more popular, "guaranteeing" that solving EO
        // optimally can't be derived from the scramble is a nice thing to
        // have, I think.  (Someone who was both unscrupulous and lucky could
        // see that R' F R doesn't affect U2/D2 EO, and therefore find out how
        // to solve EO by looking at the solution ignoring the R' F R.  That
        // being said, it still does change things, and I like how
        // finger-tricky/reversible the current prefix is.)  Just my two cents,
